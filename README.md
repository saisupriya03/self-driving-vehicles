# A Driving Decision Strategy (DDS) Based on Machine Learning for an Autonomous Vehicle

This project implements a machine learning-based Driving Decision Strategy (DDS) to assist autonomous vehicles in making real-time driving decisions such as speed control, steering angle adjustments, and lane changes.

## 📊 Dataset Description

- Total Records 978
- Total Columns 12  
  - 11 columns represent DDS input features.
  - 1 column is the class label can be either `speed`, `steering_angle`, or `lane_change`.
